      <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">Everyday, family members and friends of COVID patients are tapping into all their contacts earnestly hoping to find a recovered person who is willing to donate plasma. Convalescent plasma therapy is one of the options explored to save some patients.
  
      Transfusion medicine specialist Dr. Hitesh Kumar, also head of the blood bank at KIMS, explained about who all can donate plasma, how many times a person can donate plasma, and if there will be any changes to one’s health after the donation.<br><br><br>
  
      Plasma from those who recovered from COVID-19 contains antibodies that neutralise coronavirus. It is expected that the mortality rate might come down and patients will recover when plasma filled with the neutralising antibodies are infused into them. The process is still in clinical trial stages at Gandhi Hospital. However, it is increasingly opted at private hospitals, and thus, the flood of requests from family members desperate to save their loved ones.Because you fought the infection, your plasma now contains COVID-19 antibodies. These antibodies provided one way for your immune system to fight the virus when you were sick, so your plasma may be able to be used to help others fight off
      the disease.<br><br><br>
      Convalescent refers to anyone recovering from a disease. Plasma is the yellow, liquid part of blood that contains antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body in response to infections. Convalescent plasma from patients who have already recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contain antibodies against COVID-19. Giving this convalescent plasma to hospitalized people currently fighting COVID-19 may help them recover. FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to be used in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease. Based on scientific evidence available, the FDA concluded this product may be effective in treating COVID-19 and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.<br><br><br>
      <b>I Have Fully Recovered From COVID-19. Am I Eligible to Donate Plasma?<br><br></b>
      
      People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma, which
      may help save the lives of other patients. COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered
      individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by
      a laboratory test and meet other donor qualifications. Individuals must have complete resolution of symptoms for at
      least 14 days prior to donation. A negative lab test for active COVID-19 disease is not necessary to qualify for
      donation.<br><br><br>
      <b>I Haven’t Had COVID-19. What Can I Do to Help?<br><br></b>
      You can consider donating blood! One blood donation can save up to three lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused
      unprecedented challenges to the U.S. blood supply. Donor centers have experienced a dramatic reduction in donations due
      to the implementation of social distancing and the cancellation of blood drives. Blood is needed every day to provide
      lifesaving treatments to a variety of patients. You can help ensure that blood continues to be available for patients by
      finding a blood donor center near you to schedule your donation. Several sites also have information about donating
      plasma.<br><br></b>
      <b>How Can I Donate Plasma?<br><br></b>
